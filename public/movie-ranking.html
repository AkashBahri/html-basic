        <h1>Movie Recommendations by Akash Bahri</h1>
        <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
        <hr>
            <h3>In Time</h3>
            <p>
                A great movie by Justin Timberlake. <br>
                One of my favourites, becuase of it's unique concept which makes you think of time as currency and value it like money.<br> 
                Which sadly most people run after and forget about time often.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Bol Bachhan</h3>
            <p>
                A hillarious Bollywood movie with a versatile cast.<br> 
                Ajay Devgun has always been a great action hero but throught his career he has done several comic roles and absolutely nailed them.<br>
                It was great to see Krishna from COmedy circus get a decent role in a mainstream B-Wood Movie. <br>
            </p>
            <h3>The Exam</h3>
            <p>
                A great watch definitely. I recommend all my friends to watch it.<br>
                Very engaging throught till the End, It is a great thriller movie.<br>
                Even though I loveed the movie the ending scnene wanted me to ask the director to give me back the 2 hours of my life :P<br>
